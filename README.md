Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Assignements

This repository contains the iPython Notebooks of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree assignements. These are not directly usable since data and complementary code are missing. Consider them as reports to get an overview of the studied fields in this nanodegree.

# Projects
## Exploratory Project - Titanic Survival Exploration
<i>First steps with NumPy and Pandas.</i>
<br><br>
In this project, we will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age.<br>We will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until we are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data.<br>This project will introduce us to some of the concepts of machine learning.

## Model Evaluation and Validation - Predict Boston Housing Prices
<i>Use NumPy and Scikit-Learn to model observed data, and gauge how well our models perform.</i>
<br><br>
In this project, we will apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.<br>We will first explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset.<br>Next, we will properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. We will then analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This will enable us to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data.<br>Finally, we will test this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to our statistics.

## Supervised Learning - Build a Student Intervention System
<i>Learn how Supervised Learning models such as Decision Trees, SVMs, Neural Networks, etc. are trained to model and predict labeled data.</i>
<br><br>
A local school district has a goal to reach a 95% graduation rate by the end of the decade by identifying students who need intervention before they drop out of school. As software engineers contacted by the school district, our task is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam, by constructing an intervention system that leverages supervised learning techniques.<br>The board of supervisors has asked that we find the most effective model that uses the least amount of computation costs to save on the budget.<br>We will need to analyze the dataset on students' performance and develop a model that will predict the likelihood that a given student will pass, quantifying whether an intervention is necessary.
<br><br>
## Unsupervised Learning - Create Customer Segments
<i>Learn how to find patterns and structures in unlabeled data, perform feature transformations and improve the predictive performance of our models.</i>
<br><br>
In this project we will apply unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data.<br>We will first explore the data by selecting a small subset to sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another.<br>Afterwards, we will preprocess the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers.<br>With the good, clean customer spending data, we will apply PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data.<br>Finally, we will compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.

## Reinforcement Learning - Train a Smartcab to Drive
<i>Use Reinforcement Learning algorithms like Q-Learning to train artificial agents to take optimal actions in an environment</i>
<br><br>
In this project we will apply reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time.<br>We will first investigate the environment the agent operates in by constructing a very basic driving implementation.<br>Once our agent is successful at operating within the environment, we will then identify each possible state the agent can be in when considering such things as traffic lights and oncoming traffic at each intersection.<br>With states identified, we will then implement a Q-Learning algorithm for the self-driving agent to guide the agent towards its destination within the allotted time.<br>Finally, we will improve upon the Q-Learning algorithm to find the best configuration of learning and exploration factors to ensure the self-driving agent is reaching its destinations with consistently positive results.
