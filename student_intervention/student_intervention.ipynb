In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "### Implementation: Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",

    "Let's imagine a flat planet with only dogs and cats. After 10,000 years of intense war between the two peoples, they finally understand that no one will ever beat the other one and commonly decide to make peace.<br>\n",
    "As they are very tired both dogs and cats fell asleep at the same time and none can move anymore.<br>\n",
    "However, given all the loss on both sides, they really don't like each other and want a **boundary to separate the two species**.<br><br>\n",
    "<u>On this planet, cats are in the north and dogs are in the south.</u>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The King of the dogs and the King in the North, which are communicating via smartphones to instaure peace, cannot agree on how to split the earth into two territories. Thus, they decide to use the help of a neutral foreigner to solve their problem.<br>\n",
    "As you are a galactic traveler passing by, you get contacted.<br>\n",
    "However, **you can only make laser boundaries which are lines or planes (or hyperplanes)**.<br>\n",
    "Additionally, your laser boundaries make some noise and the closer a dog or a cat is from the boundary the less it can sleep, and you should not favorite the cat people or the dog people. **So you'd better have the boundary equally distant to the two groups.**<br><br>\n",
    "This is a flat planet and as cats are in the north and dogs are in the south, you can easily install a laser boundary that have cats on one side and dogs on the other ones. The first part of the contract is completed (separate them), now you have to deal with having your boundary equally distant to the two groups. So you walk to find the closest cats and dogs to the line and you adjust the line so that it get farer from them (so that they can sleep). And you do it again and until **you find the best line to separate the two peoples.** You have just finished to **train** an algorithm called Support Vector Machines and this line is the result of your work.<br><br>\n",
    "Happy of it, you fall asleep. But in the night, you hear lots of screams from different places. You first are scared (because the night is dark and full of terrors) but you then decide to see what is going on. So you go to each place where something is crying (obviously a dog or a cat but you cannot recognize it as you lost a bit of your audition in an accident. Damned asteroids ! Stupid spaceship !). But at each of these places, you cannot see anything (it's the night) and as no cat or dog was there during the day, you have no idea if it is a dog or a cat. You have to feed each one of the crying creatures and fast as it is getting cold (winter is coming) and you don't want it to die.<br>Luckily you have dog food and cat food on you, but you must not give the wrong food or it will die as well. So you use the only thing that can help you : the shining laser boundary which tells you if you are on the cats side or the dogs side.<br>\n",
    "For each crying creature, you check on which side you are and you accordingly give to the creature the dog or the cat food.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "On the morning, you are being told that these were traps made by both kings and cat to see if your line is able to determine if something is a cat or a dog. And as the kings knew if each one was a cat or a dog, your boundary is given a **test score**. You are surprised, but happy that you got a good score (at least you know that you can accurately predict wether a thing is a cat or a dog thanks to the boundary you made).\n",
    "<br><br><br>\n",
    "As both kings were happy of your work, you obtain a certification and update you LinkedIn. Thanks to that, you are called for another very similar mission on another planet.<br><br>\n",
    "It is exactly the same problem (the dogs-cats war happens in the entire universe), however this time it happens than the dogs' kingdom was under siege and there are cats all around them, as in the following B plot. <u>You cannot use a simple straight line anymore to separate them</u>. However, you have in your pocket The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to help you.<br><br>\n",
    "Remember that your laser boundaries can also be plans. So you follow your guide and put a flying balloon on each dogs and cats, which now all levitate at different altitude. With an appropriate mathemagic formula for your hydrogen balloons, levitating dogs and cats are now separable by a laser plan boundary. Just like on the other planet, you know equally maximize the distance between the boundary and the two groups and you obtain the **best plane to separate them**. Look on the 3D plot red cats and blue dogs separated by your green laser plane boundary.<br>\n",
    "Now you explode all the balloons, and at the same time, while dogs and cats are falling back on their planet, you fold your plane so that no dog or cat get hurt and when they all are back on their feets (mostly cats, obviously), you take the intersection of your folded boundary with the earth and have the new best separation between dogs and cats, as you can see from above the planet on the last plot, blue dogs and red cats are equally distant from the separating boundary. Your job is done and prepare some dog and cat food to get ready to being tested by the kings as last time.<br><br><br>\n",
    "With all you success, you now create a The Intergalactic Boundary Services Corporation, the most successful company ever. You receive Nobel Prize for stopping all wars in the universe. As this peace lasts, trade between dogs and cats begins and, possessing all borders in the universe, a few tax borders everywhere and you can fairly buy a pretty good new spaceship.<br>\n",
